This Attribute can also be assigned to an object through the Item Attribute (page 105) to create hand-held weaponry like swords, wands, bows, or even offensive suits of armor.</p><p>Weapons can be used on a single target each round within melee range (i.e. the target must be in very close proximity to the character) unless further modified by the Range Enhancement (page 128). A character can only make one Weapon attack per action. This Attribute may be assigned multiple times to give a character (or Item) a variety of different attacks.</p><p>When designing a Weapon, the player (with DM input) should determine exactly how the Weapon works. Is it a breath weapon? Retractable claws? A spell-like blast? A psychic attack? A special rapid-strike martial arts finishing manoeuvre? The nature of the Weapons will give the attack role-playing flavour, will provide insight into how the character uses it, and will help determine what Enhancements and Limiters are appropriate. The description will also determine the Weapon’s damage type – bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, radiant, etc. (see page 173).</p><h3>Proficiency Benefit</h3><p>All magical, spiritual, psionic, racial, or otherwise paranormal attacks created with the Weapon Attribute (and independent of physical Items used as weapons in combat) are considered simple weapons, and consequently characters benefit from their Proficiency Bonus when attacking with them. See page 48.</p><h3>Weapons and Ability Modifiers</h3><p>Ability modifiers are also normally added to attack rolls using Weapon Attributes. The attacking character adds their Strength modifier for melee attacks or Dexterity modifier for ranged attacks. This application can be modified with DM approval, with consideration given to how the Weapon functions. For example, no modifier or a different Ability modifier may apply, such as a Dexterity modifier for a light “finesse-style” melee weapon, or an Intelligence modifier for a ranged psionic assault.</p><h3>Weapon Damage</h3><p>A successful attack with the Weapon Attribute inflicts 1d4 damage for each Rank. For higher Weapon Ranks, the multiple d4 units can alternatively be expressed in other types of dice, as indicated in Table 14. For example, 2d4 could instead be 1d8. Unless the DM or player decides otherwise, characters normally add their Strength or Dexterity Ability modifier – the same modifier used for the attack roll – to the Weapon damage as well.</p><h3>Customizing Weapons</h3><p>The Weapon Attribute includes options to modify its functionality beyond the simple +1d4 damage/Rank baseline description. Modifications that provide an additional benefit or otherwise improve the Weapon are called Enhancements, while those that impose a drawback or weaken the impact of the Weapon are called Limiters. The descriptions under each Enhancement and Limiter indicates the number of times they can be assigned, and what effects are associated with multiple assignments. Some modifiers are sufficiently beneficial or detrimental that they must be assigned two, three, or even four times to have any effect.</p><p>Each Enhancement reduces the Weapon’s damage by 1d4, while each Limiter increases the Weapon’s damage by 1d4 – though the Weapon Attribute Rank remains unchanged. The damage modification is cumulative when adding Enhancements and Limiters.</p><h3>Zero Damage</h3><p>The damage a Weapon inflicts can drop to 0d4 (i.e. zero damage) through the assignment of one or more Enhancements, though the minimum Rank that you can assign to your character remains at Rank 1 (costing 1 Point). Although no physical damage is inflicted by 0d4 Weapons, they can still have utility if they have been assigned one or more of the following Enhancements: Drain, Flare, Incapacitating, Irritant, Quake, or Tangle. Assigning multiple Enhancements that drop Weapon damage below 0d4 is forbidden; in these instances, assign additional Ranks to the Weapon (costing 1 Point/Rank) until its damage increases to at least 0d4.</p><h3>Multiple Saving Throws</h3><p>If a Weapon is assigned multiple Enhancements that each require Saving Throws, the target rolls each of them individually to determine the effects – whether they use the same or different Ability Scores – since the Saves indicate different challenges. For example, the Constitution Save for Blight determines whether the target succumbs to the effects, while the Constitution Save for Contagious determines whether the target also passes on the effects to people who touch them. The DM may decide that some Enhancement combinations are best resolved with a single combined Saving Throw instead.</p><h3>Unarmed: The Free Weapon</h3><p>An unarmed person can strike an opponent using fists, feet, head, etc. This is a free Weapon Attribute that all characters automatically have, and it does not need to be recorded on character sheets. Such attacks are considered a Rank 0 Weapon that inflicts a flat 1 damage upon a successful hit.</p><h3>Available Weapon-Specific Enhancements</h3><ul><li><p></p></li></ul><h3>Available Weapon-Specific Limiters</h3><ul><li><p></p></li></ul><table><thead style=\"text-align:center\"><tr><th scope=\"col\" style=\"white-space:nowrap\">Rank</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"white-space:nowrap\"><p>Base<br />Damage</p></th><th scope=\"col\"><p>Alternate<br />Damage Dice</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>1d4</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>2d4</td><td>1d6; 1d8</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>3d4</td><td>2d6; 1d10; 1d12</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>4d4</td><td>3d6; 2d8</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>5d4</td><td>2d10</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>6d4</td><td>4d6; 3d8; 2d12</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>7d4</td><td>5d6; 3d10</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>8d4</td><td>4d8</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>9d4</td><td>6d6; 3d12</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>10d4</td><td>7d6; 5d8; 4d10</td></tr></tbody></table>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Anime 5E pp. 124-130","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":"inst"},"target":{"value":1,"width":null,"units":"","type":"creature"},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":"touch"},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":"","recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","effects":[],"flags":{"magicitems":{"enabled":false,"equipped":false,"attuned":false,"charges":"0","chargeType":"c1","destroy":false,"destroyFlavorText":"reaches 0 charges: it crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.","rechargeable":false,"recharge":"0","rechargeType":"t1","rechargeUnit":"r1","sorting":"l"},"core":{"sourceId":"Actor.s4Ozg63igYR1agM6.Item.GPt7UpM73vwf7sBK"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1670368916319,"modifiedTime":1670386264342,"lastModifiedBy":"Gk3gL94MefjaC4oW"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"Gk3gL94MefjaC4oW":3},"_id":"1rS2RuZFN8RWee4c"}

At low Ranks, the character is an initiate and can only effect small changes in the Attribute's influence. At high Ranks, the character holds mastery over a particular realm and has an intimate understanding of all things relating to the Attribute sphere. Examples of major categories over which the character could have control include: a broad concept or idea (love, communication, travel, strength), a major aspect of nature (weather, magnetism, gravity, electricity, animals, vegetation), or a broad sphere of influence (cities, health, necromancy, truth, weapons, shapeshifting).</p><p>If the character makes a successful Ability check (as determined by the DM; see page 153), they can manipulate aspects of the chosen area of influence. Since this is a story-driven Attribute, there are few definitive rules regarding what a character can and cannot do with a particular Attribute Rank, with the Rank progression being primarily descriptive.</p><p>This is a very open-ended Attribute and should be discussed with the DM at length to determine the scope and limitations in their game, including how Enhancements (page 142) can customise effects. Proper use of Dynamic Powers will not unbalance the game, but rather can provide opportunities for character innovation. In general, the effect can vary depending on the need of the story and emotional intensity of the situation. It is for creative players and DMs who are comfortable with a story-driven approach to the handling of powers.</p><h3>Energy Cost</h3><p>Using Dynamic Powers is taxing on the character's body, though, and drains from their pool of Energy (see page 176). The amount of Energy spent equals the square of the effect’s associated Dynamic Powers Rank (1 Energy for Rank 1 effects; 4 Energy for Rank 2 effects; 9 Energy for Rank 3 effects; etc.). Consequently, the Deplete Limiter (page 146) cannot also be applied to Dynamic Powers.</p><h3>Existing 5e Spells</h3><p>Groups that desire the flexibility of Dynamic Powers – but would prefer a more rigid application that uses existing 5E spell Levels – can instead align the Attribute Ranks with accessible spell Levels. The spells used can originate from any magical discipline (abjuration, enchantment, evocation, etc.), but must still reasonably associate with their sphere of influence. The maximum comparable spell Level available to the character equals one less than the Dynamic Powers Attribute Rank.</p><h2>Dynamic Powers - Lesser</h2><p>Attribute cost changes to 5 Points/Rank. This focused variation restricts the character's influence to a minor (not major) category that has a reduced scope, but otherwise has similar capabilities. Examples include: a classical element (water, fire, wind, earth), a limited concept or idea (lust, protection, charm, pride), a minor aspect of nature (temperature, friction, insects, sunlight, blood, sea creatures), or a limited sphere of influence (keys, silence, cats, writing, swords, a small locality).</p><p><strong>Allowable Enhancement(s):</strong> Assigned effects as required while manipulating area of influence<br /><strong>Prohibited Limiter(s):</strong> Deplete</p><table><thead style=\"text-align:center\"><tr><th scope=\"col\" style=\"white-space:nowrap\">Rank</th><th scope=\"col\">Effect</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td><strong>Minor Effects</strong> – Comparable to cantrips.

Items can represent powerful relics, magical artifacts, or even experimental technology; characters can obtain regular or mundane objects such as standard weapons, armour, and adventuring equipment without this Attribute as determined by the DM. A device or object that cannot be lost or stolen (such as something implanted in or fused to the character's body) is not an Item. Any such device is considered part of the character, and thus the player should use Points to acquire the relevant Attributes directly instead of assigning them through the Item Attribute.</p><p>Each Rank of the Item Attribute grants the character 5 Points that can either be allocated to a single Item, or divided amongst multiple Items as the player desires.</p><p>Assign the Item any Attributes appropriate to its normal function that will benefit the character while using it. For example, a magic sword would have Weapon, a ring of invisibility would have Undetectable, and winged boots would have Flight. A complex artifact, such as a 100-foot-tall flying transformable clockwork golem, could have a multitude of Attributes, such as Change State, Features, Flight, Resilient, Supersense, Weapon, etc.</p><p>Attributes that an Item has do not usually stack with those of a character. If an Asrai character (who has Flight Rank 1) is riding on a magic carpet that also has Flight Rank 1, the character does not gain access to Flight Rank 2. The DM may make exceptions where it seems appropriate (such as magical armor with the AC Bonus Attribute stacking with the character's AC Bonus).</p><p>Items can also be assigned Defects (page 132) provided they directly impact the utility of the Item or affect the user. Defects that are usually inappropriate for Items unless approved by the DM include Accountability, Ism, Marked, Nemesis, Obligated, Significant Other, Secret, and Wanted. Nevertheless, the DM may make exceptions where this seems reasonable, such as a stolen Item coming with the Wanted Defect if it is the Item (rather than the character) that particular foes are after. In the same manner, a great artifact such as a Ring of Power might be Hounded and even have a Nemesis attached to it.</p><p>Items usually have no Ability Scores (but may be given Augmented if they boost their user's Ability Scores), but they may have Armor, Skill, or Tool proficiencies to represent bonuses to appropriate dice checks (such as a Ring of Detection Item adding to a Perception Skill check).</p><p>Items are assumed to be lifeless objects, so no special Attributes or Defects are required to represent this status. For example, even though one cannot affect an Item by poisoning it, there is no need to assign the Immunity Attribute to avoid this unless the Item protects the people wearing it from the poison. Similarly, an Item is immune to threats like disease or lack of food, and they cannot normally be affected by mental or spiritual attacks. Note that an Item has no ability to heal any damage that it suffers, though, and must be repaired as usual instead (as determined by the adventure narrative).</p><p>See the Chapter 10: Items (page 190) for numerous detailed examples and descriptions of Items.</p><h2>Attributes</h2><ul><li><p></p></li></ul><h2>Defects</h2><ul><li><p></p></li></ul>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Anime 5E p. 105","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","effects":[],"flags":{"magicitems":{"enabled":false,"equipped":false,"attuned":false,"charges":"0","chargeType":"c1","destroy":false,"destroyFlavorText":"reaches 0 charges: it crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.","rechargeable":false,"recharge":"0","rechargeType":"t1","rechargeUnit":"r1","sorting":"l"},"core":{"sourceId":"Actor.s4Ozg63igYR1agM6.Item.OoxTiaOus4uWXqrA"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1670158373036,"modifiedTime":1670158659753,"lastModifiedBy":"Gk3gL94MefjaC4oW"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"Gk3gL94MefjaC4oW":3},"_id":"VdNfyBUbpgP2SEN5"}

This Attribute can also be assigned to an object through the Item Attribute (page 105) to create hand-held weaponry like swords, wands, bows, or even offensive suits of armor.</p><p>Weapons can be used on a single target each round within melee range (i.e. the target must be in very close proximity to the character) unless further modified by the Range Enhancement (page 128). A character can only make one Weapon attack per action. This Attribute may be assigned multiple times to give a character (or Item) a variety of different attacks.</p><p>When designing a Weapon, the player (with DM input) should determine exactly how the Weapon works. Is it a breath weapon? Retractable claws? A spell-like blast? A psychic attack? A special rapid-strike martial arts finishing manoeuvre? The nature of the Weapons will give the attack role-playing flavour, will provide insight into how the character uses it, and will help determine what Enhancements and Limiters are appropriate. The description will also determine the Weapon’s damage type – bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, radiant, etc. (see page 173).</p><h3>Proficiency Benefit</h3><p>All magical, spiritual, psionic, racial, or otherwise paranormal attacks created with the Weapon Attribute (and independent of physical Items used as weapons in combat) are considered simple weapons, and consequently characters benefit from their Proficiency Bonus when attacking with them. See page 48.</p><h3>Weapons and Ability Modifiers</h3><p>Ability modifiers are also normally added to attack rolls using Weapon Attributes. The attacking character adds their Strength modifier for melee attacks or Dexterity modifier for ranged attacks. This application can be modified with DM approval, with consideration given to how the Weapon functions. For example, no modifier or a different Ability modifier may apply, such as a Dexterity modifier for a light “finesse-style” melee weapon, or an Intelligence modifier for a ranged psionic assault.</p><h3>Weapon Damage</h3><p>A successful attack with the Weapon Attribute inflicts 1d4 damage for each Rank. For higher Weapon Ranks, the multiple d4 units can alternatively be expressed in other types of dice, as indicated in Table 14. For example, 2d4 could instead be 1d8. Unless the DM or player decides otherwise, characters normally add their Strength or Dexterity Ability modifier – the same modifier used for the attack roll – to the Weapon damage as well.</p><h3>Customizing Weapons</h3><p>The Weapon Attribute includes options to modify its functionality beyond the simple +1d4 damage/Rank baseline description. Modifications that provide an additional benefit or otherwise improve the Weapon are called Enhancements, while those that impose a drawback or weaken the impact of the Weapon are called Limiters. The descriptions under each Enhancement and Limiter indicates the number of times they can be assigned, and what effects are associated with multiple assignments. Some modifiers are sufficiently beneficial or detrimental that they must be assigned two, three, or even four times to have any effect.</p><p>Each Enhancement reduces the Weapon’s damage by 1d4, while each Limiter increases the Weapon’s damage by 1d4 – though the Weapon Attribute Rank remains unchanged. The damage modification is cumulative when adding Enhancements and Limiters.</p><h3>Zero Damage</h3><p>The damage a Weapon inflicts can drop to 0d4 (i.e. zero damage) through the assignment of one or more Enhancements, though the minimum Rank that you can assign to your character remains at Rank 1 (costing 1 Point). Although no physical damage is inflicted by 0d4 Weapons, they can still have utility if they have been assigned one or more of the following Enhancements: Drain, Flare, Incapacitating, Irritant, Quake, or Tangle. Assigning multiple Enhancements that drop Weapon damage below 0d4 is forbidden; in these instances, assign additional Ranks to the Weapon (costing 1 Point/Rank) until its damage increases to at least 0d4.</p><h3>Multiple Saving Throws</h3><p>If a Weapon is assigned multiple Enhancements that each require Saving Throws, the target rolls each of them individually to determine the effects – whether they use the same or different Ability Scores – since the Saves indicate different challenges. For example, the Constitution Save for Blight determines whether the target succumbs to the effects, while the Constitution Save for Contagious determines whether the target also passes on the effects to people who touch them. The DM may decide that some Enhancement combinations are best resolved with a single combined Saving Throw instead.</p><h3>Unarmed: The Free Weapon</h3><p>An unarmed person can strike an opponent using fists, feet, head, etc. This is a free Weapon Attribute that all characters automatically have, and it does not need to be recorded on character sheets. Such attacks are considered a Rank 0 Weapon that inflicts a flat 1 damage upon a successful hit.</p><h3>Available Weapon-Specific Enhancements</h3><ul><li><p></p></li></ul><h3>Available Weapon-Specific Limiters</h3><ul><li><p></p></li></ul><table><thead style=\"text-align:center\"><tr><th scope=\"col\" style=\"white-space:nowrap\">Rank</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"white-space:nowrap\"><p>Base<br />Damage</p></th><th scope=\"col\"><p>Alternate<br />Damage Dice</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>1d4</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>2d4</td><td>1d6; 1d8</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>3d4</td><td>2d6; 1d10; 1d12</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>4d4</td><td>3d6; 2d8</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>5d4</td><td>2d10</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>6d4</td><td>4d6; 3d8; 2d12</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>7d4</td><td>5d6; 3d10</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>8d4</td><td>4d8</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>9d4</td><td>6d6; 3d12</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>10d4</td><td>7d6; 5d8; 4d10</td></tr></tbody></table>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Anime 5E pp. 124-130","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":"inst"},"target":{"value":1,"width":null,"units":"","type":"creature"},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":"touch"},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":"","recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"mwak","attackBonus":"0","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[["@scale.samurai.weapon-damage + @mod",""]],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"Samurai Lv. 11","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","effects":[],"flags":{"magicitems":{"enabled":false,"equipped":false,"attuned":false,"charges":"0","chargeType":"c1","destroy":false,"destroyFlavorText":"reaches 0 charges: it crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.","rechargeable":false,"recharge":"0","rechargeType":"t1","rechargeUnit":"r1","sorting":"l"},"core":{"sourceId":"Actor.s4Ozg63igYR1agM6.Item.GPt7UpM73vwf7sBK"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1670368916319,"modifiedTime":1670925358117,"lastModifiedBy":"Gk3gL94MefjaC4oW"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"Gk3gL94MefjaC4oW":3},"_id":"cN0kLe938FmM8OYo"}

Examples of such organizations include governments, military units, feudal systems, organized crime rings, secret guilds and societies, and some religions.</p><p>The organization selected should have moderate power within the game setting, and the DM and player should discuss the proposed organization before gameplay begins to ensure they are both on the same page regarding the organization's scope and importance. Connected should not be assigned if the selected organization will not have a meaningful impact on the game or only makes appearances infrequently.</p><p>Connected is a relatively inexpensive Attribute because the benefits the connection provides always come with strings attached. The character must follow the goals of the organization in order to gain the use of its resources. The other members are assumed to be loyal to the organization itself, not the Connected character. Followers with personal loyalty to the character are better represented by Companion Attribute (page 95), while resources that belong directly to the character are represented by Item (page 105) and Wealth (page 121) Attributes. These Attributes can blend with one another, of course. For example, the leader of a powerful thieves' guild could have both a high Connected Attribute (representing their status and access to resources) as well as a number of Companions (those individuals personally devoted to the character, for whatever reason).</p><p>For campaigns in which all players belong to the same organization that is central to the game (such as a family unit, secret society, or adventuring guild), the DM may decide that the Connected Attribute is not required. Consequently, this Attribute is optional; the DM may prefer to treat organization membership as a background detail instead.</p><p>Since Connected measures the absolute power that a particular position grants, many smaller organisations will only have a few Ranks.

{"name":"Mind Control","type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<table><tbody><tr><th>Attribute Cost</th><td>3 Points/Rank [Lesser = 1/Rank]</td></tr><tr><th>Relevant Ability</th><td>Intelligence</td></tr><tr><th>Attribute Scope</th><td>1 target; Touch; 1 minute</td></tr><tr><th>Progression</th><td>Descriptive</td></tr></tbody></table><p>This Attribute allows the character to mentally dominate other individuals, creatures, or entities through touch, typically for a duration of one minute or one dramatic scene (or earlier if the target breaks free from control). Magic users, psionic adepts, and creatures with hypnotic powers such as demons or vampires are among those likely to have Mind Control.</p><p>Mind Control requires an attack action to use and a successful touch attack roll (gaining an advantage on the roll; see page 168). If used on an unwilling target, it requires a successful Intelligence contest check. If the check succeeds, the target is under the attacker's control until they have an opportunity to break the connection. A target that breaks a character's Mind Control three times in one day is immune to further attempts by that character until the following day.</p><p>When a player character is under the effects of Mind Control, the DM can take over the character from the player when necessary, although it is usually more fun if the player (with DM guidance) continues to role-play their own character. Characters who have been Mind Controlled will not usually remember events that occurred during the time period they are controlled and will have a gap in their memories.</p><p>A target may attempt to break control under two circumstances: whenever they are given a command that conflicts with the nature of the character, and whenever the DM deems it appropriate for dramatic effect. To break control, the target must win an Intelligence contest check.</p><h3>Against Target's Nature</h3><p>If a Mind Controlled target is commanded to perform an action that they would not willingly do under normal circumstances, the target can attempt to break control. For highly distasteful or undesirable actions (such as stealing from or attacking an ally), the target receives an advantage on the contest check.</p><h3>When the DM Deems Appropriate</h3><p>If the character commands their target to perform a mundane activities (pick up that rock, fetching a drink of water, etc.), the DM may decide the target does not receive an opportunity to break established control. Even a seemingly inoffensive command such as \"sit at the table\" or \"go to sleep\", however, may have a drastic impact on the lives of others if a monster is attacking or the target is crossing a narrow rope bridge at the time. In these instances, the DM may give the target a chance to break free of the Mind Control even if the target does not regard a command as specifically dangerous or distasteful (which would present an opportunity to end the control). This option puts the DM in direct control of the situation, to the benefit of the campaign story.</p><h2>Mind Control - Lesser</h2><p>Attribute cost changes to 1 Point/Rank. The character's Mind Control is restricted to a narrow category of targets, such as a specific Race (Asrai, Nekojin, Elves, etc.), monster type (demons, reptilians, dragons, Neomorphs), animal type (birds, fish, mammals, forest animals, arctic animals, etc.), or affiliation (priests, magic users, royalty, etc.).</p><p><strong>Allowable Enhancement(s):</strong> Area, Duration, Range, Targets</p><table><thead style=\"text-align:center\"><tr><th scope=\"col\" style=\"white-space:nowrap\">Rank</th><th scope=\"col\">Effect</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td><strong>Moderate ability.</strong> The character can give extremely basic, non-aggressive suggestions such as \"turn around\", \"run away\", \"scream\", etc.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td><strong>Significant ability.</strong> The character can give simple, non-aggressive suggestions such as \"go pour me a pint\", \"tell that shopkeeper to put coins into a bag and hand it over to you\", \"grab that pick axe and start mining for gems\", etc.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td><strong>Major ability.</strong> The character can give complex, non-aggressive suggestions such as \"pick up the dulcimer case, talk your way through the waterfront guard checkpoint using a disguise, and then load the case into the sailing barge's hidden smuggling compartment\".</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td><strong>Exceptional ability.</strong> In addition to the capabilities of Rank 3, the character can also make aggressive suggestions (which includes attacking).</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td><strong>Extreme ability.</strong> In addition to the capabilities of Rank 4, the character can also permanently erase brief events from the victim's memory.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td><strong>Legendary ability.</strong> In addition to the capabilities of Rank 5, the character can also permanently erase and alter complex and prolonged events from the victim's memory.</td></tr></tbody></table>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Anime 5E pp. 106-107","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":1,"units":"minute"},"target":{"value":1,"width":null,"units":"","type":"creature"},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":"touch"},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":"","recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":"int","actionType":"abil","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","effects":[],"flags":{"magicitems":{"enabled":false,"equipped":false,"attuned":false,"charges":"0","chargeType":"c1","destroy":false,"destroyFlavorText":"reaches 0 charges: it crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.","rechargeable":false,"recharge":"0","rechargeType":"t1","rechargeUnit":"r1","sorting":"l"},"core":{"sourceId":"Actor.s4Ozg63igYR1agM6.Item.yCsYc7KjwUIAQRxU"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1670364152527,"modifiedTime":1670454636511,"lastModifiedBy":"Gk3gL94MefjaC4oW"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"Gk3gL94MefjaC4oW":3},"_id":"n4YnAXheGM8pnvkX"}

This Attribute can also be assigned to an object through the Item Attribute (page 105) to create hand-held weaponry like swords, wands, bows, or even offensive suits of armor.</p><p>Weapons can be used on a single target each round within melee range (i.e. the target must be in very close proximity to the character) unless further modified by the Range Enhancement (page 128). A character can only make one Weapon attack per action. This Attribute may be assigned multiple times to give a character (or Item) a variety of different attacks.</p><p>When designing a Weapon, the player (with DM input) should determine exactly how the Weapon works. Is it a breath weapon? Retractable claws? A spell-like blast? A psychic attack? A special rapid-strike martial arts finishing manoeuvre? The nature of the Weapons will give the attack role-playing flavour, will provide insight into how the character uses it, and will help determine what Enhancements and Limiters are appropriate. The description will also determine the Weapon’s damage type – bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, radiant, etc. (see page 173).</p><h3>Proficiency Benefit</h3><p>All magical, spiritual, psionic, racial, or otherwise paranormal attacks created with the Weapon Attribute (and independent of physical Items used as weapons in combat) are considered simple weapons, and consequently characters benefit from their Proficiency Bonus when attacking with them. See page 48.</p><h3>Weapons and Ability Modifiers</h3><p>Ability modifiers are also normally added to attack rolls using Weapon Attributes. The attacking character adds their Strength modifier for melee attacks or Dexterity modifier for ranged attacks. This application can be modified with DM approval, with consideration given to how the Weapon functions. For example, no modifier or a different Ability modifier may apply, such as a Dexterity modifier for a light “finesse-style” melee weapon, or an Intelligence modifier for a ranged psionic assault.</p><h3>Weapon Damage</h3><p>A successful attack with the Weapon Attribute inflicts 1d4 damage for each Rank. For higher Weapon Ranks, the multiple d4 units can alternatively be expressed in other types of dice, as indicated in Table 14. For example, 2d4 could instead be 1d8. Unless the DM or player decides otherwise, characters normally add their Strength or Dexterity Ability modifier – the same modifier used for the attack roll – to the Weapon damage as well.</p><h3>Customizing Weapons</h3><p>The Weapon Attribute includes options to modify its functionality beyond the simple +1d4 damage/Rank baseline description. Modifications that provide an additional benefit or otherwise improve the Weapon are called Enhancements, while those that impose a drawback or weaken the impact of the Weapon are called Limiters. The descriptions under each Enhancement and Limiter indicates the number of times they can be assigned, and what effects are associated with multiple assignments. Some modifiers are sufficiently beneficial or detrimental that they must be assigned two, three, or even four times to have any effect.</p><p>Each Enhancement reduces the Weapon’s damage by 1d4, while each Limiter increases the Weapon’s damage by 1d4 – though the Weapon Attribute Rank remains unchanged. The damage modification is cumulative when adding Enhancements and Limiters.</p><h3>Zero Damage</h3><p>The damage a Weapon inflicts can drop to 0d4 (i.e. zero damage) through the assignment of one or more Enhancements, though the minimum Rank that you can assign to your character remains at Rank 1 (costing 1 Point). Although no physical damage is inflicted by 0d4 Weapons, they can still have utility if they have been assigned one or more of the following Enhancements: Drain, Flare, Incapacitating, Irritant, Quake, or Tangle. Assigning multiple Enhancements that drop Weapon damage below 0d4 is forbidden; in these instances, assign additional Ranks to the Weapon (costing 1 Point/Rank) until its damage increases to at least 0d4.</p><h3>Multiple Saving Throws</h3><p>If a Weapon is assigned multiple Enhancements that each require Saving Throws, the target rolls each of them individually to determine the effects – whether they use the same or different Ability Scores – since the Saves indicate different challenges. For example, the Constitution Save for Blight determines whether the target succumbs to the effects, while the Constitution Save for Contagious determines whether the target also passes on the effects to people who touch them. The DM may decide that some Enhancement combinations are best resolved with a single combined Saving Throw instead.</p><h3>Unarmed: The Free Weapon</h3><p>An unarmed person can strike an opponent using fists, feet, head, etc. This is a free Weapon Attribute that all characters automatically have, and it does not need to be recorded on character sheets. Such attacks are considered a Rank 0 Weapon that inflicts a flat 1 damage upon a successful hit.</p><h3>Available Weapon-Specific Enhancements</h3><ul><li><p></p></li></ul><h3>Available Weapon-Specific Limiters</h3><ul><li><p></p></li></ul><table><thead style=\"text-align:center\"><tr><th scope=\"col\" style=\"white-space:nowrap\">Rank</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"white-space:nowrap\"><p>Base<br />Damage</p></th><th scope=\"col\"><p>Alternate<br />Damage Dice</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>1d4</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>2d4</td><td>1d6; 1d8</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>3d4</td><td>2d6; 1d10; 1d12</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>4d4</td><td>3d6; 2d8</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>5d4</td><td>2d10</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>6d4</td><td>4d6; 3d8; 2d12</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>7d4</td><td>5d6; 3d10</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>8d4</td><td>4d8</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>9d4</td><td>6d6; 3d12</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>10d4</td><td>7d6; 5d8; 4d10</td></tr></tbody></table>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Anime 5E pp. 124-130","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":"inst"},"target":{"value":1,"width":null,"units":"","type":"creature"},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":"touch"},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":"","recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"mwak","attackBonus":"0","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[["@scale.hunter.weapon-damage + @mod",""]],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"Hunter Lv. 9","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","effects":[],"flags":{"magicitems":{"enabled":false,"equipped":false,"attuned":false,"charges":"0","chargeType":"c1","destroy":false,"destroyFlavorText":"reaches 0 charges: it crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.","rechargeable":false,"recharge":"0","rechargeType":"t1","rechargeUnit":"r1","sorting":"l"},"core":{"sourceId":"Actor.s4Ozg63igYR1agM6.Item.GPt7UpM73vwf7sBK"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1670368916319,"modifiedTime":1670925360412,"lastModifiedBy":"Gk3gL94MefjaC4oW"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"Gk3gL94MefjaC4oW":3},"_id":"ng3LJoKhpJASJjig"}

The Portal is created immediately adjacent to the character and is usually no larger than a four-foot radius; the Area and Range Enhancements can modify these parameters (page 143). The Attribute will normally transport the user and everyone else within the surrounding radius to another dimension. A Portal can usually be held open as long as a character desires.</p><p>The Attribute Rank determines the number of one-way dimensional transitions the user has mastered. For example, “Home to The Abyss” is a single dimension link – the user can travel from their homeland to the hell-dimension of The Abyss, but not back. If the character wished to return, a second transition, \"The Abyss to Home\" or some other form of travel (such as an established gateway) is needed. Assigning both \"Home to The Abyss\" and \"The Abyss to Home\" is two transitions and requires two Levels of Portal – but sometimes this power is a one-way journey only.</p><p>A character with only a few Ranks of this Attribute can also select links in a way that ensures they need to travel through a chain of dimensions to get home. For example, someone with Level 3 might have: Home to The Abyss, The Abyss to Elysium, Elysium to Home. This means the character would have to pass through the The Abyss hell-dimension each time they wished to reach Elysium from their homeland, which could be a perilous journey indeed.</p><p>Portal is not another version of the Teleport Attribute (page 119). A character will usually travel to a point in the other dimension that most closely maps with the point in their own reality (DM's discretion). The DM may also rule that visitors are likely to appear at certain nexus points (such as a holy shrine or sacred forest) regardless of their origin, or that their arrival is completely random.</p><h3>Using Portal On Others</h3><p>Portal may be used offensively to send one touched target to another dimension with or without going oneself. For larger targets that won't fit through the standard four-foot-radius opening, the Portal must also have the sufficient assignments of the Area Enhancement to accommodate the target's bulk. This requires the Duration Enhancement, plus the Targets Enhancement to affect more than a single target (see page 143). This sort of Portal is often possessed by Items such as an ancient shrine that contains a gate to another world, sucking those nearby into it. The target will be in the dimension for a maximum amount of time indicated by the Duration Enhancement. The target is released from the dimension once the Duration ceases, reappearing at the point from which they vanished, or optionally, a different point congruent with their present location, depending on how that dimension maps with their origin.</p><p>Using Portal this way on others requires a successful touch attack roll (gaining an advantage on the roll; see page 168). If the attack succeeds, the target is sucked into the Portal unless they choose to resist. Resisting requires a successful DC 15 Dexterity Saving Throw. If the target has the @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.Xt8Rsln71cV3O8vP]{Immutable} Attribute (page 104) they may add that Attribute bonus to their Save roll to resist. If a particular target resists three successive attempts at transporting them to another dimension, they are immune to further Portal attacks from the character for the rest of the dramatic scene.</p><p><strong>Allowable Enhancement(s):</strong> Area, Duration, Range, Targets</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Anime 5E p. 111","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":"spec"},"target":{"value":1,"width":null,"units":"","type":"creature"},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":"touch"},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":"","recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":"int","actionType":"mwak","attackBonus":"0","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"dex","dc":15,"scaling":"flat"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","effects":[],"flags":{"magicitems":{"enabled":false,"equipped":false,"attuned":false,"charges":"0","chargeType":"c1","destroy":false,"destroyFlavorText":"reaches 0 charges: it crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.","rechargeable":false,"recharge":"0","rechargeType":"t1","rechargeUnit":"r1","sorting":"l"},"core":{"sourceId":"Actor.s4Ozg63igYR1agM6.Item.pbg3T4hWBHywdLz9"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1670365218948,"modifiedTime":1670454655216,"lastModifiedBy":"Gk3gL94MefjaC4oW"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"Gk3gL94MefjaC4oW":3},"_id":"oqSA7UnTpNKofOOX"}

The character may possess a supernatural, racial, or trained concealment ability, or may have a psychic or magical talent that causes observers to overlook them. Since Undetectable can be a very powerful Attribute when optimized for Class abilities (such as those benefitting from sneak attacks), its use may be subject to limits imposed by the DM.</p><p>For each Undetectable Rank, the player selects one sense or technique to which the character is \"invisible\". Senses include the Human range for sight, hearing, taste, touch, or smell. Detection techniques include: astral, ethereal, infrared, magic, mental, sonar, spiritual, ultraviolet, vibration, etc. Invisibility to sight or hearing cost two Attribute slots each rather than only one, since they are usually more valuable during game adventures (DM's discretion).</p><p>While the character may not be detected using specific methods, indirect evidence can still reveal the character's presence. For example, a character who is Undetectable to sight will still leave footprints in muddy ground. Similarly, a vase that is knocked from a table by a character who is Undetectable to sound will still make noise as it smashes on the floor.</p><p>In normal combat situations involving humanoid opponents, a character who is Undetectable to sight has a great advantage. Only after the invisible character gives away their general position (for example, by attacking with a sword or shouting) can they be attacked. Attacking opponents suffer disadvantages (page 153) on their attack rolls. Conversely, defending against a foe who is Undetectable to sight is also more difficult, with an advantage (page 153) applied on the attacker's roll.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Anime 5E p. 120","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","effects":[],"flags":{"magicitems":{"enabled":false,"equipped":false,"attuned":false,"charges":"0","chargeType":"c1","destroy":false,"destroyFlavorText":"reaches 0 charges: it crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.","rechargeable":false,"recharge":"0","rechargeType":"t1","rechargeUnit":"r1","sorting":"l"},"core":{"sourceId":"Actor.s4Ozg63igYR1agM6.Item.J46Molte8BzVV7Uw"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1670368520103,"modifiedTime":1670386202560,"lastModifiedBy":"Gk3gL94MefjaC4oW"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"Gk3gL94MefjaC4oW":3},"_id":"zmhQOY2mpsHxv9w4"}
