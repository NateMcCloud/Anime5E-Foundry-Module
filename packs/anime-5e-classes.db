{"name":"Magical Girl/Guy","type":"class","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>The forces of light sometimes choose the least likely candidate to be their defender. Enter the Magical Girl or Magical Guy (or even Magical Person or Magical Being) – once a normal person with normal worries like snagging a mate, preparing for academic training, or just eating the right food. With the appearance of a strange little creature, however, everything changed. Now wielding a strange artifact that grants weird and wonderful powers, the Magical Girl/Guy is charged with protecting friends, family, and often the rest of the kingdom or even the world. Oddly enough, only their adventuring allies seem to recognize their true identity under their costume.</p><p><strong>Preferred Races:</strong> Asrai, Half-Troll, Kodama, Satyr<br /><strong>Rare Races:</strong> Archfiend, Demonaga</p><h1>Characteristics</h1><p>Magical Girls/Guys usually have mentor friends – companion creatures that guide and advise them about their new role as protectors. The mentors try to teach them about magical powers as well, often with mixed results. Depending on the source of their powers, Magical Girls/Guys display special attacks that vary greatly for each individual, usually linked to a relic or special tool that unlocked their magical abilities. Battling against monsters much uglier than their worst nightmares, Magical Girls/Guys learn to jump high, fly quickly, regenerate wounds, and tap into special powers as they learn new weapon attacks and unlock more wonders from their magical artifacts.</p><h2>Relationships With Other Classes</h2><p>Magical Girls/Guys have complex relationships with many Classes. They understand the Pet Monster Trainers' plights navigating their servant/mentor role, and thus they get along well. Benders, Dynamic Spellbinders, and Psionicists are also good companions, since they usually share similar goals and methods. Adventurers and Isekai Students will often be objects of the Magical Girls'/Guys' admirations or affections, and emerge as trusted allies. They admire the martial abilities of the Hunters, Ninja, Samurai, and Warders, and wish they could fight just as well. Magical Girls/Guys are frequently disquieted by the personal motivations of Brokers, Shadow Warriors, and Techknights, so it may take more time to form bonds of friendship with them.</p><table><thead style=\"text-align:center\"><tr><th scope=\"col\" style=\"white-space:nowrap\">Level</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"white-space:nowrap\"><p>Prof.<br />Bonus</p></th><th scope=\"col\">Features</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td>+2</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.Nj8xhZUGV94shsGr]{Alternate Identity} [1]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.uisAx2fUGQ44X9LW]{Companion} [5]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.2tcOIxjcKAhVGhz1]{Weapon} [1]</td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td>+2</td><td>+1 Point [1]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.uisAx2fUGQ44X9LW]{Companion} [5]</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>+2</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.VdNfyBUbpgP2SEN5]{Item} [4]; Ability Score Improvement [2]</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>+2</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.7A0oMUBTwFkJpuzE]{Jumping} [1]; +2 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.QeGPoMAGo4xlUe8G]{Regeneration} [2]</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>+3</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.SjVFv5fB5LCiI521]{Flight} [3]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.rX0O7UJXE2gNo3qr]{Skill Proficiency} [1]</td></tr><tr><td>6th</td><td>+3</td><td>+2 Points [2]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.VdNfyBUbpgP2SEN5]{Item} [4]</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>+3</td><td>+2 Points [2]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.QeGPoMAGo4xlUe8G]{Regeneration} [1]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.2tcOIxjcKAhVGhz1]{Weapon} [1]</td></tr><tr><td>8th</td><td>+3</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.LdlnqPwOpL66qw34]{Extra Action} [4]</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>+4</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.VdNfyBUbpgP2SEN5]{Item} [4]; Ability Score Improvement [2]</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>+4</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.6MGJV8NJk7JGkV8z]{Saving Throw Proficiency} [2]</td></tr><tr><td>11th</td><td>+4</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.SjVFv5fB5LCiI521]{Flight} [3]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.rX0O7UJXE2gNo3qr]{Skill Proficiency} [1]</td></tr><tr><td>12th</td><td>+4</td><td>+3 Points [3]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.2tcOIxjcKAhVGhz1]{Weapon} [1]</td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td>+5</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.VdNfyBUbpgP2SEN5]{Item} [4]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.QeGPoMAGo4xlUe8G]{Regeneration} [1]</td></tr><tr><td>14th</td><td>+5</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.8abULAyWSNR4Bwdf]{Dynamic Powers} [10]</td></tr><tr><td>15th</td><td>+5</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.VdNfyBUbpgP2SEN5]{Item} [4]; Ability Score Improvement [2]</td></tr><tr><td>16th</td><td>+5</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.SjVFv5fB5LCiI521]{Flight} [3]</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>+6</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.rX0O7UJXE2gNo3qr]{Skill Proficiency} [1]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.2tcOIxjcKAhVGhz1]{Weapon} [1]</td></tr><tr><td>18th</td><td>+6</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.VdNfyBUbpgP2SEN5]{Item} [4]</td></tr><tr><td>19th</td><td>+6</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.2tcOIxjcKAhVGhz1]{Weapon} [1]</td></tr><tr><td>20th</td><td>+6</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.8abULAyWSNR4Bwdf]{Dynamic Powers} [10]</td></tr></tbody></table><h1>Class Features</h1><p>Magical Girls/Guys gain the following Class features:</p><h3>Hit Points</h3><ul><li>d8 Hit Dice + Constitution modifier each Level [4]</li><li>8 + Constitution modifier Hit Points at 1st Level</li><li>1d8 (or 5) + Constitution modifier HP at higher Levels</li></ul><h3>Proficiencies</h3><ul><li>Light armor and shield proficiencies [2]</li><li>Simple and two martial weapon proficiencies of choice [1]</li><li>One tool proficiency of choice [1]</li><li>Wisdom and Charisma Saving Throw proficiencies [4]</li><li>Three Skill proficiencies of choice [3]</li></ul><p>Total 1st-Level Base Points = 15 + 4 Proficiency Bonus = 19<br />Leveling Points (Hit Dice/Proficiency Bonus/Attributes) = 173<br />Bonus Points through Levels 1-20 = 8<br /><strong>Final Class Points Over 20 Levels = 200</strong></p><h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3><p>When a Magical Girl/Guy reaches 3rd Level, and again at 9th, and 15th Level, they can increase one Ability Score of choice by 2, or two Ability Scores of choice by 1 each. Ability Scores can only be raised above the Level-based benchmarks with DM approval (see Table 01, page 20).</p><h3>Companion</h3><p>Most Magical Girls/Guys need a loyal partner to assist with their training and help them unlock new talents. At 1st Level, they gain a Rank 1 Companion that is constructed from up to 60 Points (page 95). The Companion powers up quickly at 2nd Level, adding another 10 Points.</p><h3>Dynamic Powers</h3><p>Veteran Magical Girls/Guys broaden their talent scope and capacity through dedication and hard work. At 14th Level, they select one specific major category area of influence for their Dynamic Powers (page 99), and they gain that Attribute at Rank 1. At 20th Level, they gain an additional +1 Rank in the same (or different, in rare instances) Dynamic Powers category.</p><h3>Extra Actions</h3><p>As Magical Girls/Guys gain practical knowledge during battles they unlock an unrestricted Extra Action each round starting at 8th Level (page 101).</p><h3>Flight</h3><p>Whether they use wings or their own paranormal powers, Magical Girls/Guys can fly at up to 30 feet/round at 5th Level. This increases to 90 feet/round at 11th Level and again to 300 feet/round at 16th Level (page 102).</p><h3>Item</h3><p>Wondrous and mystical artifacts complete the ensemble for Magical Girls/Guys.

{"name":"Samurai","type":"class","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>The Way of the Warrior demands that the Samurai hold themselves to the key virtues of justice, compassion, control, courage, honor, integrity, loyalty, and respect. They are dedicated warriors who seek perfection at the edge of their blades, tempering their spirits in the heat of combat and honing their values at the same time that they sharpen their swords. They enter combat with aplomb and deadly calm, hesitating to unsheathe their weapons because once they do, they are honor-bound to finish the battle. The most experienced Samurai are destined to lead others, and can infuse their souls into attacks to cut through metal and stone as if it were paper.</p><p><strong>Preferred Races:</strong> Half-Dragon, Parasite<br /><strong>Rare Races:</strong> Blinkbeast, Kodama</p><h1>Characteristics</h1><p>Walking the Way of the Warrior bestows upon the Samurai a great power and responsibility. They can strike like lightning and move like a hurricane, sometimes cutting down their enemies in a single stroke. Despite their tremendous skill, Samurai are careful to take an opponent's measure before engaging in combat, cutting off any escape with their speed and agility. They feel the flow of combat in their veins and gain a superhuman awareness of their surroundings to the point that they can fight without seeing. Samurai are a match for almost anything.</p><h2>Relationships With Other Classes</h2><p>Valuing honor and discipline, Samurai feel a kinship with Magical Girls/Guys, Shadow Warriors, and Warders. They carry neutral opinions of Adventurers, Hunters, and Isekai Students, reserving judgment until they observe how these potential allies conduct themselves. Interestingly, Samurai frequently form friendships with Brokers, appreciating the insights they provide into current affairs and the connections they bring to an adventuring party. They regard the actions of Benders, Dynamic Spellbinders, Pet Monster Trainers, Psionicists, and Techknights with suspicion, though, believing they take an easier path by using outside forces to serve them.</p><table><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\" style=\"white-space:nowrap\">Level</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"white-space:nowrap\"><p>Prof.<br />Bonus</p></th><th scope=\"col\">Features</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td>+2</td><td>+2 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.IjkxUkfQOHUqSodL]{Edge} (Initiative Rolls) [2]</td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td>+2</td><td>+1 Point [1];

{"name":"Broker","type":"class","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>When adventurers are searching for something specific, something rare, something unique, they need look no further than the multi-talented Broker. Many years of training have honed supernatural and intuitive talents in the most respected Brokers, who can not only detect hidden features in objects but also tap into their business networks to extract additional information or locate potential buyers. Brokers have the widest range of skilled knowledge and tool competencies amongst all the Classes, and they put their expertise to good use. If an adventuring party has the coin and the connections, a Broker can get what they want or tell them more about what they have – or perhaps instead relate a fascinating tale about the unknown.</p><p><strong>Preferred Races:</strong> Demonaga, Kodama, Nekojin, Slime<br /><strong>Rare Races:</strong> Archfiend, Asrai, Parasite</p><h1>Characteristics</h1><p>Brokers thrive on connections – with people, information, artifacts, history, resources, and of course, coins and treasure. Shrewd negotiators and master manipulators, Brokers are an essential component of successful adventuring explorations – whether characters are aware of this need or not. Always friendly, often garrulous, yet rarely impractical, Brokers are generous with their assistance and helpful when caught in tight places. They make excellent allies and confidants; they know the value of keeping secrets and carefully guarding information. Brokers aren't the first Class that parties seek to recruit for a dungeon crawl, yet their resourcefulness, diverse skill set, and quick Ability Score advancement make them worth consideration.</p><h2>Relationships With Other Classes</h2><p>Brokers are consummate professionals who easily form bonds with individuals of all Classes. They are drawn to Classes that share similar societal perspectives, though, including Isekai Students, Magical Girls/Guys, Psionicists, and Warders. Additionally, Brokers will curate relationships with Classes that rely on artifacts and other objects, such as Hunters, Pet Monster Trainers, and Techknights. Brokers often develop wariness of Classes that are widely varied in their talents, since diversified characters may not regard the Broker's abilities as highly as others; this includes such Classes as Adventurers, Benders, and Dynamic Spellbinders.</p><table><thead style=\"text-align:center\"><tr><th scope=\"col\" style=\"white-space:nowrap\">Level</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"white-space:nowrap\"><p>Prof.<br />Bonus</p></th><th scope=\"col\">Features</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td>+2</td><td>+2 Points [2];

{"name":"Pet Monster Trainer","type":"class","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Born of fantasy magic, divine intervention, or simply part of the natural order of things, there are monsters roaming across the continents. Some, like Neomorphs (page 230), can be disgustingly cute and docile even if they can unleash fire from their eyes or shoot bolts of lightning from their ... tails. Pet Monster Trainers take it upon themselves to tame these creatures and use their potentially deadly natural weapons towards some particular goal – perhaps as simple as gladiatorial badge collecting, as straight-forward as dungeon crawling, or as complex as saving the kingdom. A few Pet Monster Trainers organize tournaments to see who can work better with their pets and cultivate their innate abilities, though most are happy to spend their time exploring, collecting, and training.</p><p><strong>Preferred Races:</strong> Demonaga, Kodama, Satyr<br /><strong>Rare Races:</strong> Blinkbeast, Half-Dragon, Slime</p><h1>Characteristics</h1><p>Pet Monster Trainers gain powerful allies in the form of their monsters, befriending them readily and learning about their abilities – which they subsequently develop through training, exercise, and fights against other pet monsters or other kinds of opponents. The bond between master and pet monster is so strong that the Pet Monster Trainer perceives their monster's thoughts over time, increasing their co-ordination and teamwork. As a reward for gladiatorial success, Pet Monster Trainers gain a measure of wealth that they use to treat both themselves and their pets, too. When teaming up in a party with other explorers and adventurers, Pet Monster Trainers are a package deal.</p><h2>Relationships With Other Classes</h2><p>Pet Monster Trainers get along with Magical Girls/Guys, but sometimes wonder why their own pet monster keeps all the power to itself. If their pet monster is a product of alchemy or natural development, the Pet Monster Trainer often seeks friendships with Techknights and Warders; alternatively, if their pet is a magical creature, then the Trainer's attention shifts to Benders, Dynamic Spellbinders, and Psionicists. Trainers form bonds easily with Adventurers and Isekai Students, though they are more cautious when interacting with Hunters, Ninja, Samurai, and Shadow Warriors.</p><table><thead style=\"text-align:center\"><tr><th scope=\"col\" style=\"white-space:nowrap\">Level</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"white-space:nowrap\"><p>Prof.<br />Bonus</p></th><th scope=\"col\">Features</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td>+2</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.uisAx2fUGQ44X9LW]{Companion} [5]</td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td>+2</td><td>+2 Points [2]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.xTYiNPRNRQrmLoy8]{Monster Training} [1]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.rX0O7UJXE2gNo3qr]{Skill Proficiency} [1]</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>+2</td><td>+2 Points [2]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.uisAx2fUGQ44X9LW]{Companion} [5]</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>+2</td><td>+2 Points [2]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.xTYiNPRNRQrmLoy8]{Monster Training} [1]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.xVLx2YCNqhLOda77]{Telepathy - Lesser} (Pet Monster) [1]; Ability Score Improvement [2]</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>+3</td><td>+3 Points [3]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.uisAx2fUGQ44X9LW]{Companion} [5]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.rX0O7UJXE2gNo3qr]{Skill Proficiency} [1]</td></tr><tr><td>6th</td><td>+3</td><td>+4 Points [4]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.6MGJV8NJk7JGkV8z]{Saving Throw Proficiency} [2]</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>+3</td><td>+2 Points [2]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.uisAx2fUGQ44X9LW]{Companion} [5]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.xTYiNPRNRQrmLoy8]{Monster Training} [1]</td></tr><tr><td>8th</td><td>+3</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.rX0O7UJXE2gNo3qr]{Skill Proficiency} [1]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.zFnJjLe4DdvaL2hw]{Wealth} [3]; Ability Score Improvement [2]</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>+4</td><td>+2 Points [2]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.uisAx2fUGQ44X9LW]{Companion} [5]</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>+4</td><td>+4 Points [4]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.xTYiNPRNRQrmLoy8]{Monster Training} [1]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.LdlnqPwOpL66qw34]{Extra Actions - Lesser} [2]</td></tr><tr><td>11th</td><td>+4</td><td>+2 Points [2]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.uisAx2fUGQ44X9LW]{Companion} [5]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.rX0O7UJXE2gNo3qr]{Skill Proficiency} [1]</td></tr><tr><td>12th</td><td>+4</td><td>+2 Points [2]; +!

{"name":"Techknight","type":"class","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Nearly two centuries ago, a giant fireball could be seen from many kingdoms streaking brightly across the night sky before it descended below the horizon and presumably into the sea.</p><p>The presumptions were wrong. The object was not a fireball, but a spaceship that crashed into a small archipelago inhabited by a large tribe of Humans who had little experience with the continental world. The ship was largely destroyed, and no living creatures were discovered, but strewn about the crash site were hundreds of suits of bizarre armor. The suits were painted many colors, and though they afforded protection similar to chain mail (AC 16), they were significantly lighter and allowed a greater range of movement (i.e. no Strength requirement; no penalty to Stealth checks). With this unexplained gift from the heavens, thus began the martial Order of the Techknights. Over the subsequent decades, the Techknights have expanded across the world to bring peace into the land by vanquishing those creatures and humanoids who terrorize the innocent and the helpless. Stories of the \"sky cave\" are passed down from generation to generation, as are the suits of prized armor.</p><p><strong>Preferred Races:</strong> Grey, Nekojin<br /><strong>Rare Races:</strong> Demonaga, Fairy, Haud, Satyr, Slime</p><h1>Characteristics</h1><p>Though the existence of their Order is not widely known, Techknights are sometimes described by learned scholars as \"faithless Paladins\" – champions of those who cannot adequately defend themselves, but without the religious motivation behind their actions. Techknights approach their duty with respect and dedication, though they rarely take themselves too seriously.</p><h2>Relationships With Other Classes</h2><p>Techknights can form strong relationships with all Classes, though their combat focus naturally means that they align with other warrior Classes more easily, such as Hunters, Ninja, Samurai, Shadow Warriors, and Warders. They are also attracted to the enigmatic nature of Brokers and Isekai Students. Classes with paranormal or magical powers are not as relatable for Techknights, but they judge an individual's worth by their actions and not their labels.</p><table><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\" style=\"white-space:nowrap\">Level</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"white-space:nowrap\"><p>Prof.<br />Bonus</p></th><th scope=\"col\">Features</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td>+2</td><td>+2 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.2XDqrp7h1ShbZoP0]{Combat Technique} [2]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.ef5UfBbtGd7IE66h]{Connected} (Techknight Order) [1]; Techknight Armor [0]</td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td>+2</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.VdNfyBUbpgP2SEN5]{Item} [4]</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>+2</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.LdlnqPwOpL66qw34]{Extra Actions} [4]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.Tz8CfG5ZBWotfhWJ]{Protected} (-1 Melee damage)</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>+2</td><td>Ability Score Improvement [2]</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>+3</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.2XDqrp7h1ShbZoP0]{Combat Technique} [1]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.Tz8CfG5ZBWotfhWJ]{Protected} (-1 Ranged damage) [1]</td></tr><tr><td>6th</td><td>+3</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.VdNfyBUbpgP2SEN5]{Item} [4]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.rX0O7UJXE2gNo3qr]{Skill Proficiency} [1]</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>+3</td><td>+2 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.IjkxUkfQOHUqSodL]{Edge} (Saving Throws for 1 Ability) [2]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.Tz8CfG5ZBWotfhWJ]{Protected} (-1 Melee damage) [1]</td></tr><tr><td>8th</td><td>+3</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.2XDqrp7h1ShbZoP0]{Combat Technique} [1]; Ability Score Improvement [2]</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>+4</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.LdlnqPwOpL66qw34]{Extra Actions} [4]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.Tz8CfG5ZBWotfhWJ]{Protected} (-1 Ranged damage) [1]</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>+4</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.VdNfyBUbpgP2SEN5]{Item} [4]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.rX0O7UJXE2gNo3qr]{Skill Proficiency} [1]</td></tr><tr><td>11th</td><td>+4</td><td>+1 Point [1]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.Tz8CfG5ZBWotfhWJ]{Protected} (-1 Melee damage) [1]</td></tr><tr><td>12th</td><td>+4</td><td>+1 Point [1]; Ability Score Improvement [2]</td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td>+5</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.LdlnqPwOpL66qw34]{Extra Actions} [4]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.Tz8CfG5ZBWotfhWJ]{Protected} (-1 Ranged damage) [1]</td></tr><tr><td>14th</td><td>+5</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.VdNfyBUbpgP2SEN5]{Item} [4]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.rX0O7UJXE2gNo3qr]{Skill Proficiency} [1]</td></tr><tr><td>15th</td><td>+5</td><td>+1 Point [1]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.FZxqlmm6H7SliH2P]{Sixth Sense} [1]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.jvByFSi8vwJ4Exoj]{Control Environment} (Silence) [1]</td></tr><tr><td>16th</td><td>+5</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.2XDqrp7h1ShbZoP0]{Combat Technique} [1]; Ability Score Improvement [2]</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>+6</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.VdNfyBUbpgP2SEN5]{Item} [4]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.Tz8CfG5ZBWotfhWJ]{Protected} (-1 Melee damage) [1]</td></tr><tr><td>18th</td><td>+6</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.LdlnqPwOpL66qw34]{Extra Actions} [4]</td></tr><tr><td>19th</td><td>+6</td><td>Ability Score Improvement [2]</td></tr><tr><td>20th</td><td>+6</td><td>+2 Points [2]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.Tz8CfG5ZBWotfhWJ]{Protected} (-1 Ranged damage) [1]</td></tr></tbody></table><h1>Class Features</h1><p>Techknights gain the following Class features:</p><h3>Hit Points</h3><ul><li>d10 Hit Dice + Constitution modifier each Level [5]</li><li>10 + Constitution modifier Hit Points at 1st Level</li><li>1d10 (or 6) + Constitution modifier HP at higher Levels</li></ul><h3>Proficiencies</h3><ul><li>All armor and shield proficiencies [4]</li><li>Simple and martial weapon proficiencies [4]</li><li>One tool proficiency of choice [1]</li><li>Dexterity and Constitution Saving Throw proficiencies [4]</li><li>Three Skill proficiencies of choice [3]</li></ul><p>Total 1st-Level Base Points = 21 + 4 Proficiency Bonus = 25<br />Leveling Points (Hit Dice/Proficiency Bonus/Attributes) = 170<br />Bonus Points through Levels 1-20 = 5<br /><strong>Final Class Points Over 20 Levels = 200</strong></p><h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3><p>When a Techknight reaches 4th Level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th Level, they can increase one Ability Score of choice by 2, or two Ability Scores of choice by 1 each.

{"name":"Bender","type":"class","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Though many tavern songs celebrate the accomplishments of famous magi and warriors, tales of dynamic specialists who tap into the power of the world itself are shared far and wide. The Bender Class designation stems from their ability to bend elements, concepts, or forces of nature to their will. Elemental Benders (such as Water Benders, Fire Benders, etc.) are common, though wildly exotic areas of specialization – Insect Benders, Friction Benders, Silence Benders, Blood Benders, and more – can rise to fame and prominence as well. Unlike standard Fifth Edition spellcasting Classes, Benders are not limited to a specific spell list. While their Dynamic Powers Rank effects are framed by traditional spell power Levels, the scope of their effects within their specialization area ranges well beyond, and is primarily limited by their Rank and creativity.</p><p><strong>Preferred Races:</strong> Asrai, Half-Troll, Nekojin<br /><strong>Rare Races:</strong> Grey, Slime</p><h1>Characteristics</h1><p>Benders focus their lives on improving and diversifying their area of specialization, and are eager to undertake adventures that give them a chance to flex their control. Their personalities often align with their area of specialization. For example, Fire Benders are hot-tempered and quick to anger; Friction Benders are smooth talkers who navigate through stressful situations with grace; Earth Benders are stable, reliable, and firm in their resolve; Silence Benders are quiet and contemplative individuals; etc. Though not immune to the allure of treasure and glory, Benders care more about their internal personal power than mere external wealth.</p><h2>Relationships With Other Classes</h2><p>With their intense focus on forces that shape the natural world, Benders find commonalities with similar Classes that they regard as awakened, such as Dynamic Spellbinders, Magical Girls/Guys, Psionicists, Shadow Warriors, and Warders. They also appreciate the enthusiasm of Adventurers, Isekai Students, and Ninja while on adventures of exploration. Benders frequently regard with indifference (or perhaps disdain) the more externally focused Classes – Brokers, Hunters, Pet Monster Trainers, Samurai, and Techknights.</p><table><thead style=\"text-align:center\"><tr><th scope=\"col\" style=\"white-space:nowrap\">Level</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"white-space:nowrap\"><p>Prof.<br />Bonus</p></th><th scope=\"col\">Features</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td>+2</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.8abULAyWSNR4Bwdf]{Dynamic Powers - Lesser} [5]</td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td>+2</td><td>+2 Points [2]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.Xt8Rsln71cV3O8vP]{Immutable} [1]</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>+2</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.8abULAyWSNR4Bwdf]{Dynamic Powers - Lesser} [5]</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>+2</td><td>+2 Points [2]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.lapRqhoBTgrhbqit]{Energized} [1]; Ability Score Improvement [2]</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>+3</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.8abULAyWSNR4Bwdf]{Dynamic Powers - Lesser} [5]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.rX0O7UJXE2gNo3qr]{Skill Proficiency} [1]</td></tr><tr><td>6th</td><td>+3</td><td>+2 Points [2]; +2 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.IjkxUkfQOHUqSodL]{Edge} (Attacks with Dynamic Powers) [2]</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>+3</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.8abULAyWSNR4Bwdf]{Dynamic Powers - Lesser} [5]</td></tr><tr><td>8th</td><td>+3</td><td>+2 Points [2]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.lapRqhoBTgrhbqit]{Energized} [1]; Ability Score Improvement [2]</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>+4</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.8abULAyWSNR4Bwdf]{Dynamic Powers - Lesser} [5]</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>+4</td><td>+2 Points [2]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.Xt8Rsln71cV3O8vP]{Immutable} [1]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.rX0O7UJXE2gNo3qr]{Skill Proficiency} [1]</td></tr><tr><td>11th</td><td>+4</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.8abULAyWSNR4Bwdf]{Dynamic Powers - Lesser} [5]</td></tr><tr><td>12th</td><td>+4</td><td>+2 Points [2]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.lapRqhoBTgrhbqit]{Energized} [1]; Ability Score Improvement [2]</td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td>+5</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.8abULAyWSNR4Bwdf]{Dynamic Powers - Lesser} [5]</td></tr><tr><td>14th</td><td>+5</td><td>+2 Points [2]; +4 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.58r5TpU6QFaAuovg]{Forced Disadvantage} (All Attacks Against Character) [4]</td></tr><tr><td>15th</td><td>+5</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.8abULAyWSNR4Bwdf]{Dynamic Powers - Lesser} [5]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.rX0O7UJXE2gNo3qr]{Skill Proficiency} [1]</td></tr><tr><td>16th</td><td>+5</td><td>+2 Points [2]; Ability Score Improvement [2]</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>+6</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.8abULAyWSNR4Bwdf]{Dynamic Powers - Lesser} [5]</td></tr><tr><td>18th</td><td>+6</td><td>+3 Points [3]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.Xt8Rsln71cV3O8vP]{Immutable} [1]</td></tr><tr><td>19th</td><td>+6</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.8abULAyWSNR4Bwdf]{Dynamic Powers - Lesser} [5]; Ability Score Improvement [2]</td></tr><tr><td>20th</td><td>+6</td><td>+4 Points [4]</td></tr></tbody></table><h1>Class Features</h1><p>Benders gain the following Class features:</p><h3>Hit Points</h3><ul><li>d8 Hit Dice + Constitution modifier each Level [4]</li><li>8 + Constitution modifier Hit Points at 1st Level</li><li>1d8 (or 5) + Constitution modifier HP at higher Levels</li></ul><h3>Proficiencies</h3><ul><li>Light armor and shield proficiencies [2]</li><li>Simple and four martial weapon proficiencies of choice [2]</li><li>No tool proficiencies [0]</li><li>Constitution and Wisdom Saving Throw proficiencies [4]</li><li>Two skill proficiencies of choice [2]</li></ul><p>Total 1st-Level Base Points = 14 + 4 Proficiency Bonus = 18<br />Leveling Points (Hit Dice/Proficiency Bonus/Attributes) = 159<br />Bonus Points through Levels 1-20 = 23<br /><strong>Final Class Points Over 20 Levels = 200</strong></p><h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3><p>When a Bender reaches 4th Level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th Level, they can increase one Ability Score of choice by 2, or two Ability Scores of choice by 1 each.

{"name":"Hunter","type":"class","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Hunters hunt, but not just for any prey. They possess a very particular set of skills – skills they have acquired over a very long adventuring career, skills that make them a nightmare for their bounties. Hunters are professional researchers, investigators, explorers, trackers, interrogators, warriors, and negotiators. They are connected to one or more organizations that advance their bounty business, and have the wealth and access to equipment and other resources to complete their contracts efficiently and effectively. For most Hunters, it's not personal; that is, unless you are standing between them and the successful completion of their contract.</p><p><strong>Preferred Races:</strong> Archfiend, Blinkbeast, Haud, Parasite<br /><strong>Rare Races:</strong> Fairy, Slime</p><h1>Characteristics</h1><p>Many people assume that Hunters would follow the path of the lone wolf, but that's rarely true. Hunters value their social networks, and work to establish relationships with many people (and some monsters!) from diverse backgrounds. These connections may unexpectedly help Hunters find contracts or locate their bounties, and have the added benefit of keeping Hunters grounded. A Hunter's individual motivation is not easy to predict, since their reasons for following this Class's path are diverse. Some do it for the thrill and danger, while others seek coin and fame; some are seeking to right wrongs and bring moral balance to their corner of the world, while others enjoy exacting revenge and inflicting pain. The world has much to offer, yet in the end, there is always the hunt.</p><h2>Relationships With Other Classes</h2><p>Hunters are comfortable allying with members of any Class that can provide them assistance, or at least won't get in their way. They get along exceptionally well with Brokers, since both professionals value the connections and resourcefulness of the other. Hunters recognize and respect the dedication of other martial Classes such as Ninja, Samurai, Shadow Warriors, Techknights, Warders – and even Pet Monster Trainers, since their pets are often extensions of combat prowess. Hunters are often uncomfortable around those with magical and paranormal powers – such as Benders, Dynamic Spellbinders, Magical Girls/Guys, and Psionicists – since their mystical talents can be more difficult to anticipate.</p><table><thead style=\"text-align:center\"><tr><th scope=\"col\" style=\"white-space:nowrap\">Level</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"white-space:nowrap\"><p>Prof.<br />Bonus</p></th><th scope=\"col\">Features</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td>+2</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.ef5UfBbtGd7IE66h]{Connected} [1]</td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td>+2</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.2XDqrp7h1ShbZoP0]{Combat Technique} [1]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.rX0O7UJXE2gNo3qr]{Skill Proficiency} [1]</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>+2</td><td>+2 Points [2]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.MU5Sb5xgG1NxcRdq]{Special Movement} [1]</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>+2</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.zFnJjLe4DdvaL2hw]{Wealth} [3]; Ability Score Improvement [2]</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>+3</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.LdlnqPwOpL66qw34]{Extra Actions} [4]</td></tr><tr><td>6th</td><td>+3</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.ef5UfBbtGd7IE66h]{Connected} [1]; +3 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.Z7rqMT6cjRjRCZsS]{Massive Damage - Lesser} (+1d6 One Type) [3]</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>+3</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.VdNfyBUbpgP2SEN5]{Item} [4]</td></tr><tr><td>8th</td><td>+3</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.rX0O7UJXE2gNo3qr]{Skill Proficiency} [1]; Ability Score Improvement [2]</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>+4</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.XwQujHBje27sK6fA]{Heightened Senses} [1]; +2 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.ng3LJoKhpJASJjig]{Weapon} [2]</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>+4</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.ef5UfBbtGd7IE66h]{Connected} [1]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.LdlnqPwOpL66qw34]{Extra Actions} [4]</td></tr><tr><td>11th</td><td>+4</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.rX0O7UJXE2gNo3qr]{Skill Proficiency} [1]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.zFnJjLe4DdvaL2hw]{Wealth} [3]</td></tr><tr><td>12th</td><td>+4</td><td>+3 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.Z7rqMT6cjRjRCZsS]{Massive Damage - Lesser} (+1d6 One Type) [3]</td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td>+5</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.2XDqrp7h1ShbZoP0]{Combat Technique} [1]; Ability Score Improvement [2]</td></tr><tr><td>14th</td><td>+5</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.XwQujHBje27sK6fA]{Heightened Senses} [1]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.VdNfyBUbpgP2SEN5]{Item} [4]</td></tr><tr><td>15th</td><td>+5</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.LdlnqPwOpL66qw34]{Extra Actions} [4]</td></tr><tr><td>16th</td><td>+5</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.zFnJjLe4DdvaL2hw]{Wealth} [3]; Ability Score Improvement [2]</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>+6</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.ef5UfBbtGd7IE66h]{Connected} [1]; +2 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.ng3LJoKhpJASJjig]{Weapon} [2]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.rX0O7UJXE2gNo3qr]{Skill Proficiency} [1]</td></tr><tr><td>18th</td><td>+6</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.2XDqrp7h1ShbZoP0]{Combat Technique} [1]; +3 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.Z7rqMT6cjRjRCZsS]{Massive Damage - Lesser} (+1d6 One Type) [3]</td></tr><tr><td>19th</td><td>+6</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.MU5Sb5xgG1NxcRdq]{Special Movement} [1]; Ability Score Improvement [2]</td></tr><tr><td>20th</td><td>+6</td><td>+4 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.ng3LJoKhpJASJjig]{Weapon} [4]</td></tr></tbody></table><h1>Class Features</h1><p>Hunters gain the following Class features:</p><h3>Hit Points</h3><ul><li>d10 Hit Dice + Constitution modifier each Level [5]</li><li>10 + Constitution modifier Hit Points at 1st Level</li><li>1d10 (or 6) + Constitution modifier HP at higher Levels</li></ul><h3>Proficiencies</h3><ul><li>Light and medium armor and shield proficiencies [3]</li><li>Simple and martial weapon proficiencies [4]</li><li>One tool proficiency of choice [1]</li><li>Constitution and Intelligence Saving Throw proficiencies [4]</li><li>Three Skill proficiencies of choice [3]</li></ul><p>Total 1st-Level Base Points = 20 + 4 Proficiency Bonus = 24<br />Leveling Points (Hit Dice/Proficiency Bonus/Attributes) = 174<br />Bonus Points through Levels 1-20 = 2<br /><strong>Final Class Points Over 20 Levels = 200</strong></p><h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3><p>When a Hunter reaches 4th Level, and again at 8th, 13th, 16th, and 19th Level, they can increase one Ability Score of choice by 2, or two Ability Scores of choice by 1 each.

{"name":"Warder","type":"class","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>A Warder has learned the mystical art of inscribing temporary marks or wards on flesh to imbue specific combat abilities on themselves and others. With careful dedication to their inscriptions (and the spending of Points during character creation or advancement!), the wards can be made permanent and infuse power into the warder. Consequently, over time a Warder's body will be adorned from head to toe in various movement, impact, and absorption wards that provide numerous enhancements in battle – extra damage, special movements, AC bonuses, additional actions, and more. Warders travel the lands, searching through musty libraries, abandoned villages, and infested crypts for new sources of unique wards to unlock even more powerful endowments.</p><p><strong>Preferred Races:</strong> Archfiend, Blinkbeast, Haud, Slime<br /><strong>Rare Races:</strong> Grey, Half-Dragon, Nekojin</p><h1>Characteristics</h1><p>These free-spirited individuals love exploring the outdoors and taking in all the wonders that nature provides. Warders dress in minimal clothes to keep their tattooed wards visible and ready for activation; consequently, they are often regarded by others as primitive and uncivilized. Warders pride themselves on being scholars of history and lore – much of which is gained during their searches for new sources of ward inscriptions. Warders have an infectious zest for life that makes them popular with children and their adventuring companions.</p><h2>Relationships With Other Classes</h2><p>Companionship flows freely from those who follow the Warder path. Their casual approach to life is appealing to members of other Classes who value fun and exploration, including Adventurers, Brokers, Isekai Students, Magical Girls/Guys, Pet Monster Trainers, and Techknights. Warders also find kinship in Classes that pursue different arcane aspects, including Benders, Dynamic Spellbinders, and Psionicists. Although Warders also value focus and dedication to a calling, their dynamic approach sometimes brings them in conflict with Hunters, Ninja, Samurai, and Shadow Warriors.</p><table><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\" style=\"white-space:nowrap\">Level</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"white-space:nowrap\"><p>Prof.<br />Bonus</p></th><th scope=\"col\">Features</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td>+2</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.Z7rqMT6cjRjRCZsS]{Massive Damage} (+1) [3];

{"name":"Shadow Warrior","type":"class","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>The title of Shadow Warrior is granted to the chosen few champions who exhibit potential to achieve an incredible harmony with negative dimensional planes. Their connection allows them to move beyond their body's physical limitations, turning into liquid or gaseous forms at lower initiate Levels and incorporeal or energy states at higher mastery Levels. Shadow Warriors can also regenerate wounds quickly and absorb negative energies to increase their size and strength. These combatants do not carry the Samurai's baggage of honor, preferring to wage battle against anyone they deem a threat to their goals – whatever those goals may be. Few can withstand the ferocity of a Shadow Warrior focussed on victory, and even fewer can understand the motivations that drive them in battle.</p><p><strong>Preferred Races:</strong> Archfiend, Grey, Half-Dragon<br /><strong>Rare Races:</strong> Asrai, Kodama, Slime</p><h1>Characteristics</h1><p>Members of the Shadow Warrior Class are an enigmatic lot. Their ties to the Negative Plane affect their bodies but do not weigh on their morality or spirit. Their talents are divided between both of their namesakes – shadow and warrior – which positions them as important contributors to their adventuring party. Although they have trained in ranged weapons, Shadow Warriors prefer to engage their opponents up close in melee combat to fully appreciate the thrill of battle. They'll take advantage of every benefit that their abilities to grow and change states provide, both in combat and while exploring.</p><h2>Relationships With Other Classes</h2><p>Shadow Warriors are typically self sufficient, and comfortable leading a solitary life with few allies. Companions offer greater opportunities for interesting engagements, though, and thus these Warriors frequently travel with other adventurers to explore, conquer, and develop. They enjoy sparring with their teammates, from Benders and Dynamic Spellbinders to Techknights and Warders, and view those Classes with magical or physical martial prowess most favorably. Shadow Warriors usually find relationships with Adventurers, Brokers, and Isekai Students awkward and unfulfilling.</p><table><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\" style=\"white-space:nowrap\">Level</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"white-space:nowrap\"><p>Prof.<br />Bonus</p></th><th scope=\"col\">Features</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td>+2</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.QeGPoMAGo4xlUe8G]{Regeneration} [1]</td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td>+2</td><td>+2 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.mTK0WVwjRbtoZryt]{Change State} [6]</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>+2</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.MRlMlXrMzYvQfQjC]{Size Change - Lesser} (Grow) [4]</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>+2</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.LdlnqPwOpL66qw34]{Extra Actions} [4]</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>+3</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.rX0O7UJXE2gNo3qr]{Skill Proficiency} [1]</td></tr><tr><td>6th</td><td>+3</td><td>+4 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.Z7rqMT6cjRjRCZsS]{Massive Damage - Lesser} (+1d8 Melee Attacks) [4]</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>+3</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.QeGPoMAGo4xlUe8G]{Regeneration} [1]</td></tr><tr><td>8th</td><td>+3</td><td>Ability Score Improvement [2]</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>+4</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.MRlMlXrMzYvQfQjC]{Size Change - Lesser} (Grow) [4]</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>+4</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.LdlnqPwOpL66qw34]{Extra Actions} [4]</td></tr><tr><td>11th</td><td>+4</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.rX0O7UJXE2gNo3qr]{Skill Proficiency} [1]</td></tr><tr><td>12th</td><td>+4</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.QeGPoMAGo4xlUe8G]{Regeneration} [1]</td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td>+5</td><td>+4 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.Z7rqMT6cjRjRCZsS]{Massive Damage - Lesser} (+1d8 Melee Attacks)</td></tr><tr><td>14th</td><td>+5</td><td>Ability Score Improvement [2]</td></tr><tr><td>15th</td><td>+5</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.MRlMlXrMzYvQfQjC]{Size Change - Lesser} (Grow) [4]</td></tr><tr><td>16th</td><td>+5</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.LdlnqPwOpL66qw34]{Extra Actions} [4]</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>+6</td><td>Ability Score Improvement [2]</td></tr><tr><td>18th</td><td>+6</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.QeGPoMAGo4xlUe8G]{Regeneration} [1]</td></tr><tr><td>19th</td><td>+6</td><td>+! @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.rX0O7UJXE2gNo3qr]{Skill Proficiency} [1]</td></tr><tr><td>20th</td><td>+6</td><td>+2 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.mTK0WVwjRbtoZryt]{Change State} [6]</td></tr></tbody></table><h1>Class Features</h1><p>Shadow Warriors gain the following Class features:</p><h3>Hit Points</h3><ul><li>d12 Hit Dice + Constitution modifier each Level [6]</li><li>12 + Constitution modifier Hit Points at 1st Level</li><li>1d12 (or 7) + Constitution modifier HP at higher Levels</li></ul><h3>Proficiencies</h3><ul><li>All armor and shield proficiencies [4]</li><li>Simple and martial weapon proficiencies [4]</li><li>No tool proficiencies [0]</li><li>Strength Saving Throw proficiency [2]</li><li>One skill proficiency of choice [1]</li></ul><p>Total 1st-Level Base Points = 17 + 4 Proficiency Bonus = 21<br />Leveling Points (Hit Dice/Proficiency Bonus/Attributes) = 179<br />Bonus Points through Levels 1-20 = 0<br /><strong>Final Class Points Over 20 Levels = 200</strong></p><h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3><p>When a Shadow Warrior reaches 8th Level, and again at 14th, and 17th Level, they can increase one Ability Score of choice by 2, or two Ability Scores of choice by 1 each.

At 20th Level, they can instead change into incorporeal or energy states.</p><h3>Extra Actions</h3><p>Combat is life! Shadow Warriors gain an unrestricted Extra Action each round starting at 4th Level and again at 10th and 16th Level (page 101).</p><h3>Massive Damage – Lesser</h3><p>With their affinity for face-to-face conflict, Shadow Warriors inflict additional melee damage (page 106). At 6th Level, melee damage is increased by +1d8 (equivalent to 4 Attribute Ranks). This is increased to +2d8 at 13th Level.</p><h3>Regeneration</h3><p>Their tie to the underplanes automatically heals a Shadow Warrior's injuries much faster than normal. At 1st Level, they regain 1 lost Hit Points each round. This increases to 2 HP/round at 7th Level, 3 HP/round 12th Level, and 4 HP/round at 18th Level (page 112).</p><h3>Size Change – Lesser (Grow)</h3><p>Shadow Warriors can absorb ambient negative energies into their bodies to increase their weight, stature, and strength. Starting at 3rd Level, they can temporarily increase their Size Rank by one category (for example, from Medium to Large, or Tiny to Small; page 112) and gain all associated benefits and drawbacks of their new size (page 44). This increases to two Size Ranks at 9th Level and 3 Size Ranks at 15th Level.</p><h3>Skill Proficiency</h3><p>Shadow Warriors are eager to learn new talents while on their adventures. At 5th, 11th, and 19th Level, they gain one additional Skill Proficiency (page 113).</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Anime 5E pp. 76-77","identifier":"shadow-warrior","levels":1,"hitDice":"d12","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"DPXBoi9MTBnMhmAD","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":"primary"},{"_id":"LyVwCcKODMiJhVYl","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"melee-massive-damage","type":"dice","distance":{"units":""},"scale":{"6":{"n":1,"die":8},"13":{"n":2,"die":8}}},"value":{},"title":"Massive Damage (Melee Attacks)","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["str"],"skills":{"number":1,"choices":["acr","ani","arc","ath","dec","his","ins","itm","inv","med","nat","prc","prf","per","rel","slt","ste","sur","cus_0","cus_1","cus_2","cus_3","cus_4","cus_5","cus_6","cus_7","cus_8","cus_9","cus_10","cus_11","cus_12","cus_13","cus_14"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":"str"}},"img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","effects":[],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Actor.s4Ozg63igYR1agM6.Item.nElCkndWztE3tM5x"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1670904230262,"modifiedTime":1670913349993,"lastModifiedBy":"Gk3gL94MefjaC4oW"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"Gk3gL94MefjaC4oW":3},"_id":"jceoLtkzTQ0CHxzw"}

Adventurers are a varied lot, as likely to find themselves exchanging witticisms in a social gathering as they are swinging from a dangling chain in a crumbling crypt. Depending on their personal preferences, they can specialize in particular areas, but one thing will always remain true: wherever they are, Adventurers can expect to run into trouble, even if they are not actively seeking it out.</p><p><strong>Preferred Races:</strong> Fairy, Haud, Slime<br /><strong>Rare Races:</strong> None — Adventurers are common for all Races</p><h1>Characteristics</h1><p>Adventurers are flexibility personified. With no particular feature to distinguish them, they have the freedom to become whatever they want to be. They are not particularly strong or innately talented, but they make up for it with dedication and courage. They can learn any trade they want and become increasingly better at it as they grow in experience. During their adventures, they discover many things about themselves and can awaken abilities that lay dormant until then, surprising friends and foes alike with each new development. They have few limits except those that they set for themselves.</p><h2>Relationships With Other Classes</h2><p>The adaptability that characterizes an Adventurer helps them get along well with almost everybody, although this does not exempt personality clashes and romantic rivalries with other people without regard to their callings. Their insatiable thirst for excitement brings them closer to Hunters, Ninja, Shadow Warriors, and Warders. With their acquisition and disposal networks, Brokers are frequent allies as well. Isekai Students and Magical Girls/Guys are natural trouble magnets and \"trouble\" may be the Adventurer's presence itself. They have no particular relationship with Benders, Dynamic Spellbinders, or Techknights, but their oddities attract an Adventurer's curiosity. They adapt easily to the rest of the Classes if they have a common interest, complicating each other's existence just by being close.</p><table><thead style=\"text-align:center\"><tr><th scope=\"col\" style=\"white-space:nowrap\">Level</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"white-space:nowrap\"><p>Prof.<br />Bonus</p></th><th scope=\"col\">Features</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td>+2</td><td>+2 Points [2]</td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td>+2</td><td>+2 Points [2]</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>+2</td><td>+3 Points [3]</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>+2</td><td>+3 Points [3]</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>+3</td><td>+4 Points [4]</td></tr><tr><td>6th</td><td>+3</td><td>+4 Points [4]</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>+3</td><td>+5 Points [5]</td></tr><tr><td>8th</td><td>+3</td><td>+5 Points [5]</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>+4</td><td>+6 Points [6]</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>+4</td><td>+6 Points [6]</td></tr><tr><td>11th</td><td>+4</td><td>+6 Points [6]</td></tr><tr><td>12th</td><td>+4</td><td>+6 Points [6]</td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td>+5</td><td>+6 Points [6]</td></tr><tr><td>14th</td><td>+5</td><td>+6 Points [6]</td></tr><tr><td>15th</td><td>+5</td><td>+6 Points [6]</td></tr><tr><td>16th</td><td>+5</td><td>+6 Points [6]</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>+6</td><td>+6 Points [6]</td></tr><tr><td>18th</td><td>+6</td><td>+6 Points [6]</td></tr><tr><td>19th</td><td>+6</td><td>+7 Points [7]</td></tr><tr><td>20th</td><td>+6</td><td>+7 Points [7]</td></tr></tbody></table><h1>Class Features</h1><p>Adventurers gain the following Class features:</p><h3>Hit Points</h3><ul><li>d6 Hit Dice + Constitution modifier each Level [3]</li><li>6 + Constitution modifier Hit Points at 1st Level</li><li>1d6 (or 4) + Constitution modifier HP at higher Levels</li></ul><h3>Proficiencies</h3><ul><li>Light and medium armor proficiencies [2]</li><li>Simple and two martial weapon proficiencies of choice [1]</li><li>Two tool proficiencies of choice [2]</li><li>Dexterity, Constitution, and Wisdom Saving Throw proficiencies [6]</li><li>Five Skill proficiencies of choice [5]</li></ul><p>Total 1st-Level Base Points = 19 + 4 Proficiency Bonus = 23<br />Leveling Points (Hit Dice/Proficiency Bonus/Attributes) = 65<br />Bonus Points through Levels 1-20 = 102<br /><strong>Final Class Points Over 20 Levels = 190</strong></p><h2>Unrestricted Bonus Points</h2><p>Unlike every other Class, the Adventurer doesn't gain any Attributes or other features as they advance in Levels.

{"name":"Isekai Student","type":"class","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Normal school life is adventure enough without the need to go gallivanting after lost treasures or joining armies. When they find themselves suddenly transported from Earth (or other home planet) to a magical fantasy world, though, Isekai Students learn that there's much more to life than strict teachers, romantic rivals, and cultural festivals. Isekai or \"different world\" stories are a common anime staple that focuses on the struggles that Students face when they find themselves in unfamiliar surroundings far from home, without knowing when or how they'll ever return. The fantasy lands unlock the Students' hidden powers – occasionally assigning them to non-Human Races! – pushing them into uncomfortable situations and terrible conflicts where they'll grow externally and within.</p><p><strong>Preferred Races:</strong> Half-Dragon, Nekojin<br /><strong>Rare Races:</strong> Grey, Half-Troll, Kodama</p><h1>Characteristics</h1><p>For all their relative normality, Isekai Students in the fantasy world seem surrounded by a special aura. They make friends easily, and not only because of their cool uniforms and marvelous gadgets. Their foreign origins and unlocked abilities seem to have the secondary effect of shielding them from much of the weirdness they might encounter in their strange surroundings. Most Isekai Students are insanely lucky as they dodge and duck during fights, and they have unexpected flashes of inspiration to guide them on their adventures. They thrive on social interactions, hoping that an individual with the solution to returning home lies just around the next corner.</p><h2>Relationships With Other Classes</h2><p>Isekai Students are strangers in a strange land, and they are eager to find friends and allies in any Class. Their openness and friendliness are appealing to many Classes, and Students will find themselves as apprentices to Benders and Dynamic Spellbinders, test subjects to Techknights and Warders, romantic interests to Magical Girls/Guys and Pet Monster Trainers, sidekicks to Adventurers and Brokers, and moral compasses to Ninja and Samurai. They may find the intensities of Hunters, Psionicists, and Shadow Warriors unsettling, yet Students are willing to lend a hand when they perceive the need. They are often everybody's friends, and they have the luck to live to regret it.</p><table><thead style=\"text-align:center\"><tr><th scope=\"col\" style=\"white-space:nowrap\">Level</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"white-space:nowrap\"><p>Prof.<br />Bonus</p></th><th scope=\"col\">Features</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td>+2</td><td>+2 Points [2];

The demon was stripped of its powers and banished to the Material Plane, where it was set upon by a guild of magi and alchemists.

The demon's mind essence integrated with nature, though, changing the land in unexpected ways.</p><p>With the proper activation, training, and guidance, humanoids can reach their next evolutionary stage – the development of psionic powers. Rather than relying on the external magical energies of The Art that is common to many Classes, though, Psionicists cultivate the limitless and forceful (yet internal) powers of the mind. Dominion over psychic energies can physically manifest in the real world to create an incredibly diverse range of effects.

Psionicists use anger and indifference as armor against fear and hatred – though they sometimes transform such armor into aggression before fully grasping their situation and observing it with unclouded judgment.</p><h2>Relationships With Other Classes</h2><p>When afforded the opportunity, Psionicists will develop favorable perspectives of, and loyal bonds with, Classes that embrace magic and paranormal powers, including Benders, Dynamic Spellbinders, Magical Girls/Guys, Shadow Warriors, and Warders. Their thirst for knowledge and understanding means Psionicists will develop connections with Adventurers and Brokers, and occasionally Isekai Students as well.

They appear to have spellcasting abilities like a Wizard, though their paranormal effects are psionically charged rather than deriving their power from the magical arts. Consequently, Psionicists frequently baffle spellcasters and monsters, who may not have been previously exposed to such wide-ranging mental capabilities. The Dynamic Spellbinder Class can be redefined as a Psionicist if desiring more flexibility than normal PHB spellcasting allows.</p><h3>PHB Spells</h3><p>Though not magically derived, the Psionicists spell slots listed in the table above grant access to all spells from the Fifth Edition PHB – as well as other Fifth Edition fantasy publications as permitted by the DM. Psionicists are not restricted to a spell category, and thus can create mental effects from any Class domain, including those associated with Bards, Clerics, Druids, Paladins, Rangers, Sorcerers, Warlocks, and Wizards. Psionicists usually ignore listed spell components when manifesting their psionic effects, though the remaining spell parameters apply as normal (such as casting time, range, duration, and description).</p><p>Psionicists do not keep a spell book (they know all Levelappropriate spells), nor are they required to prepare or memorize spell effects before use. Due to their unrestricted breadth of mental spell availability, Psionicists are assigned an \"accessible spells multiplication factor\" of 1.25 when determining the Points allocated to their spellcasting effects, as detailed under the Deconstructing Traditional Classes section (page 82).</p><p>To cast one of these psionic spell effects, the character must expend a slot of the spell's Level or higher. Psionicists regain all expended spell effect slots after a long rest.</p><h3>Cantrips Known at Each Level</h3><p>Unlike spells, Psionicists only know a specific number of chosen cantrips, but the cantrips can be cast repeatedly (i.e. no spell slots).</p><h3>Mental Ability</h3><p>Psionicists use Intelligence whenever a spell refers to spellcasting Ability. In addition, they use their Intelligence modifier both when setting the Saving Throw DC for a psionic effect, and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p><em>Save DC = 8 + Proficiency Bonus + Intelligence modifier<br />Attack modifier = Proficiency Bonus + Intelligence modifier</em></p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Anime 5E p. 72-73","identifier":"psionicist","levels":1,"hitDice":"d4","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"lB1CAnLtuPCHBMfV","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":"primary"}],"saves":["int","cha"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["acr","ani","arc","ath","dec","his","ins","itm","inv","med","nat","prc","prf","per","rel","slt","ste","sur","cus_0","cus_1","cus_2","cus_3","cus_4","cus_5","cus_6","cus_7","cus_8","cus_9","cus_10","cus_11","cus_12","cus_13","cus_14"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":"int"}},"img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","effects":[],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Actor.s4Ozg63igYR1agM6.Item.CWskCBqft2qjXnmi"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1670627578359,"modifiedTime":1670636339606,"lastModifiedBy":"Gk3gL94MefjaC4oW"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"Gk3gL94MefjaC4oW":3},"_id":"r3OVMB5IjlfhorlC"}
{"name":"Dynamic Spellbinder","type":"class","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>The World is alive, and there is no one better to prove it than the Dynamic Spellbinder. A being of power incarnate with dominion over a major sphere of influence, the Dynamic Spellbinder knows how to harness the hidden energies that move the world and shape them into whatever form they desire. Such mystical knowledge can come from a variety of sources, whether wrenched from the secrets of an ancient civilization, inherited from an occult tradition, or granted by powerful entities. Sometimes, the Dynamic Spellbinder may not even be of the humanoid Races, but rather an otherworldly being whose very nature allows it to use The Art at will.</p><p><strong>Preferred Races:</strong> Asrai, Fairy, Grey, Half-Troll, Satyr<br /><strong>Rare Races:</strong> Haud, Parasite</p><h1>Characteristics</h1><p>The main feature that distinguishes Dynamic Spellbinders from others is their extensive control over their chosen sphere of influence – be they major elements, ideologies, broad concepts, or natural phenomena. This power develops slowly over time, manifesting in the spells or spell-like effects they can invoke, as well as in the deepening of their understanding. The Dynamic Spellbinder's stores of energy expand to fuel their increasing paranormal might. The path of dynamism requires a Spellbinder to be exceptionally knowledgeable and in tune with their craft to understand what they are doing and, more importantly, how they are accomplishing it. The forces of the world itself offer insight as well, encouraging Dynamic Spellbinders to grow as people at the same time that they grow in power.</p><h2>Relationships With Other Classes</h2><p>Dynamic Spellbinders feel most comfortable with other Classes that have an understanding of aspects of The Art, such as Benders, Magical Girls/Guys, Psionicists, Shadow Warriors, and Warders. Spellbinders also form close, yet practical, relationships with Adventurers, Brokers, Isekai Students, and Pet Monster Trainers. Connections with the more violent martial Classes – such as Hunters, Ninja, Samurai, and Techknights – are frequently strained, though.</p><table><thead style=\"text-align:center\"><tr><th scope=\"col\" style=\"white-space:nowrap\">Level</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"white-space:nowrap\"><p>Prof.<br />Bonus</p></th><th scope=\"col\">Features</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td>+2</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.8abULAyWSNR4Bwdf]{Dynamic Powers} [10]</td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td>+2</td><td>+2 Points [2]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.lapRqhoBTgrhbqit]{Energized} [1]</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>+2</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.8abULAyWSNR4Bwdf]{Dynamic Powers} [10]</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>+2</td><td>+2 Points [2]</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>+3</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.8abULAyWSNR4Bwdf]{Dynamic Powers} [10]</td></tr><tr><td>6th</td><td>+3</td><td>+2 Points [2]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.lapRqhoBTgrhbqit]{Energized} [1]</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>+3</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.8abULAyWSNR4Bwdf]{Dynamic Powers} [10]</td></tr><tr><td>8th</td><td>+3</td><td>+2 Points [2]</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>+4</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.8abULAyWSNR4Bwdf]{Dynamic Powers} [10]</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>+4</td><td>+2 Points [2]</td></tr><tr><td>11th</td><td>+4</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.8abULAyWSNR4Bwdf]{Dynamic Powers} [10]</td></tr><tr><td>12th</td><td>+4</td><td>+2 Points [2]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.lapRqhoBTgrhbqit]{Energized} [1]</td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td>+5</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.8abULAyWSNR4Bwdf]{Dynamic Powers} [10]</td></tr><tr><td>14th</td><td>+5</td><td>+2 Points [2]</td></tr><tr><td>15th</td><td>+5</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.8abULAyWSNR4Bwdf]{Dynamic Powers} [10]</td></tr><tr><td>16th</td><td>+5</td><td>+2 Points [2]; +1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.lapRqhoBTgrhbqit]{Energized} [1]</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>+6</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.8abULAyWSNR4Bwdf]{Dynamic Powers} [10]</td></tr><tr><td>18th</td><td>+6</td><td>+2 Points [2]</td></tr><tr><td>19th</td><td>+6</td><td>+1 @UUID[Compendium.world.attributes-list.8abULAyWSNR4Bwdf]{Dynamic Powers} [10]</td></tr><tr><td>20th</td><td>+6</td><td>+2 Points [2]</td></tr></tbody></table><h1>Class Features</h1><p>Dynamic Spellbinders gain the following Class features:</p><h3>Hit Points</h3><ul><li>d6 Hit Dice + Constitution modifier each Level [3]</li><li>6 + Constitution modifier Hit Points at 1st Level</li><li>1d6 (or 4) + Constitution modifier HP at higher Levels</li></ul><h3>Proficiencies</h3><ul><li>No armor proficiencies [0]</li><li>Simple weapon proficiency [0]</li><li>No tool proficiencies [0]</li><li>Intelligence Saving Throw proficiency [2]</li><li>Two Skill proficiencies of choice [2]</li></ul><p>Total 1st-Level Base Points = 7 + 4 Proficiency Bonus = 11<br />Leveling Points (Hit Dice/Proficiency Bonus/Attributes) = 169<br />Bonus Points through Levels 1-20 = 20<br /><strong>Final Class Points Over 20 Levels = 200</strong></p><h3>Dynamic Powers</h3><p>At 1st Level, Dynamic Spellbinders select one specific major category area of influence for their Dynamic Powers (page 99), and they gain that Attribute at Rank 1.
